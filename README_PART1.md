# üî¨  PART - 1 Preliminary and Exploratory data analysis of aqi in india

### 	‚û°Ô∏è  DONE IN 1_exploratory_analysis_of_aqi_in_india.ipynb

# ü™ü where you can get this data?

The dataset is avaible on kaggle this is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india

* city_day csv
* city_hour csv
* station_day csv
* station_hour csv
* station csv

The links for geo json files of india are as follows:

* state geojson: https://github.com/Subhash9325/GeoJson-Data-of-Indian-States
* district geojson: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krutarthhd/india-geojson-file?select=district

********

this is the first part of the project in this we will perform 

* Preliminary and Exploratory analysis of station and station_day csv

* making the station_merged csv and using the data to visualze certain graph

OUTPUT GRAPHS GIVEN BELOW

### üìö about the dataset

the dataset has 5 csv city_day, city_hour, station_day, station_hour, station csv out of these i have used only station_day and station csv as they have more data (more than 100000 rows) 

### üìï station csv:-

this csv contains all the info on the stations

| #  | Column      | Non-Null Count | Dtype  |
|:---: | :------:      | -------------- | -----  |

* this is a combination of station and station_day csv with over 100000 rows

# üñãÔ∏è The Fun Part:

### üõ†Ô∏è 1.Preliminary data analysis:
Edit the data to prepare it for further analysis, describe the key features of the data, and summarize the results.

* station and station_day csv were merged to make station_merged csv 

* dropped all columns where aqi reading was none
* numerical missing values were replaced with means of the respective columns 
* dropped the date column and added day, month, year columns instead


### ‚õìÔ∏è 2. Exploratory data analysis with insights (the main goal of this ipynb) :

Investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods

* major Exploratory data analysis has been done of all columns, states and citites on the basis of month, year and range from 2016-2020

* these 10 types of graphs are made:

### ‚úíÔ∏è 1. trend of aqi throughout the years

* aqi has steadily decreased throughout the years with a major drop from 2019 to 2020 due to corona

### ‚úíÔ∏è 2. aqi trend of states in india

###### notice how the pollution and aqi trend in the state andra Pradesh is similar this proves the high correlation of these 3 gasses with AQI in a graphical way

### ‚úíÔ∏è 8. yearly/monthly city_toxic_gas_from_2015_2020 india function

###### this graph is misleading as not much district data was avaible in the geojson making cities with higher aqi look lighter in color


# üìå Conclusion

* Gujarat has the highest AQI in all state while Mizoram has the lowest. Delhi having the second highest aqi

* Ahmedabad has the highest AQI in all cities while Aizawl has lowest. Delhi having the second highest aqi

* PM10, PM2.5, NO2 are the highest contributors in growth of aqi this has been proved mathatically and by graphs throughout

* in southern india jan seems to be the most toxic month while april or jun seem to be the lowest in aqi
